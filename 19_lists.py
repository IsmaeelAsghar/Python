# Lists in Python
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Lists are created using square brackets

list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(list)

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

# Changeable
# The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

# List lenght
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

# The list() Constructor
# It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

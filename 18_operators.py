# Operators
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values
# Athimetic Operators

# Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

# Addition
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

# Subtraction
a = 2
b = 12
print(a - b)

# Multiplecation
a = 4
b = 6
print(a + b)

# Division
a = 11
b = 2
print(a / b)

# Modulus
a = 11
b = 3
print(a % b)

# Cycling through a list
list = ['a', 'b', 'c']
index = 5
print(list[index % len(list)])

# Exponentiation
a = 2
b = 5
print(a ** b)

# Floor division
a = 11
b = 2
print(a // b)

# Assignment Operators
# +=
# -=
# *=
# /=
# %=
# //= 
# **=

# Comparison Operators
# ==	Equal	
# !=	Not equal	
# >	Greater than	
# <	Less than	
# >=	Greater than or equal to
# <=	Less than or equal to

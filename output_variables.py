# Python print() function is used to output variables.
# In the print function, you output multiple variables seperated by comma,

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

#Also use + operator 
print(x + y + z)

# For numbers + character works as mathametical operator
a = 2
b = 8
print(a+b)

# cannot combine numbers and strings with + operator
